### 2. **Sprint & Smoke Testing**
   - **In-Sprint Automation**: Point out the identification of test scenarios within the current sprint that are automated in subsequent sprints. Ensure you explain that business approval is needed for each test scenario.
   - **Smoke Testing**: This is essential for ensuring that priority features are validated in every deployment, focusing on critical functionalities that must remain stable.

### 3. **Regression Testing**
   - **Goal**: Automating test cases that cover broader functionalities, regressing flows, and ensuring system stability in the long run. Explain how this feeds into reducing manual effort over time and improving build reliability.

### 4. **Automation Roadmap**
   - Break down the roadmap into **short-term, medium-term, and long-term** goals for the three key areas:
     - **Functional UI Automation**: Cover specific test scenarios planned across the upcoming sprints.
     - **API Automation**: Point out the importance of automating API tests for policy creation, commissions, and how these drive faster, more robust backend validations.
     - **PALI Integration Automation**: Highlight how API integration within various modules like NCAA, ALIP, FUELS, and Print Policy are structured for long-term improvement.
   - Explain the progress across milestones and emphasize continuous automation development across various stages.

### 5. **PI4 Workplan (Short-Term & Long-Term Goals)**
   - **Transaction Level Automation**: Walk through the immediate transactional tests for premium payments, reversals, policy creation, etc., and the long-term work for complex scenarios like premium mode changes, rider claims, and full surrenders.
   - **Term Scenarios Automation**: Explain how you are working to identify functional test cases and ensuring dry runs with business sign-off before full automation.

### 6. **Risks and Dependencies**
   - Call attention to the **high-priority dependencies** and the critical risks. For example:
     - Delays in term build capabilities or sign-offs from the functional team.
     - Automation scope being affected by increased test cases.
   - Present the **mitigation strategies**, like reusing existing automation scripts and adjusting timelines as necessary to minimize risk.

### 7. **High-Level Automation Process**
   - Cover the **phased approach** to automation across planning and execution:
     - **Test Planning Phase**: Identifying automation scope, prioritizing tests based on ROI, and defining timelines.
     - **Test Design Phase**: Focus on collaborating with business users to finalize and sign off on automation flows, ensuring the correct test cases are automated and feedback loops are established.
   - Mention how automation frameworks, standards, and test plans are being put into place to create a scalable process.

### 8. **Stakeholder Engagement**
   - Reiterate the **constant communication** and **collaboration with the business team** for review and feedback loops.
   - Highlight the continuous feedback-based improvements in the automation scripts before sign-off.

### 1. **Automation Strategy Overview**
   - **Start by highlighting the goal of automation**: 
     - "Our strategy is designed to complement functional testing by introducing automation that helps us improve efficiency, stability, and delivery speed."
     - "By automating test scripts, we can validate new features within sprints, reduce manual regression testing, and improve the stability of each build through smoke tests."

   - **Key Focus Areas**:
     - "Automation helps us verify business-critical features during the development cycle (in-sprint), automate regression for broader coverage, and ensure basic functionality through smoke testing."
     - "This is a highly collaborative process with functional testers who leverage automation to quickly assess if features are ready to move forward."

   - **N-1 Sprint Automation**:
     - "We ensure automation scripts are developed once components stabilize, reducing unnecessary failures and ensuring reliable testing environments."

---

### 2. **In Sprint & Smoke Testing**
   - **In-Sprint Automation**:
     - "In each sprint, we identify scenarios that are feasible for automation based on business input. These scenarios are then prioritized for the next sprint to be automated."
     - "This helps us stay agile, as automation can be applied in real-time to sprint deliverables."

   - **Smoke Testing**:
     - "Our smoke testing ensures that the priority features are validated with every deployment. This way, we have confidence that the system's critical functionalities are working before proceeding with more complex tests."
     - "It’s a safeguard that helps us catch critical issues early, providing a stable environment for further development."

---

### 3. **Regression Testing**
   - **Explain the value of regression testing**:
     - "By automating regression tests, we ensure that every new build functions correctly without affecting the existing functionalities."
     - "This drastically reduces manual testing efforts and allows us to run comprehensive tests across different versions, ensuring reliability."

   - **Highlight the long-term benefit**:
     - "Our long-term goal is to expand this regression suite to cover all core business flows, enabling faster, more confident releases."

---

### 4. **Automation Roadmap**
   - **Walk through short-, medium-, and long-term plans**:
     - "Our roadmap is structured into short, medium, and long-term goals, starting with Functional UI Automation, API Automation, and PALI Integration Automation."
     - **For Short-Term**: "Right now, we are focused on automating key functional scenarios and policies, such as policy creation and advance commissions."
     - **For Medium-Term**: "We’ll expand automation coverage to more complex scenarios, including additional scenarios for UI, API, and interface automation."
     - **For Long-Term**: "The final phase will focus on expanding this coverage further to ensure automation scripts are robust and scalable for future enhancements."
